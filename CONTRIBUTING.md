<h2>Submitting Changes</h2>
<br>
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to 44zdawg@gmail.com with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits.

<h2>Coding Conventions</h2>
<br>
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:
<ul>
<li>We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)</li>
<br>
<li>We use HAML for all views</li>
<br>
<li>We avoid logic in views, putting HTML generators into helpers</li>
<br>
<li>We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.</li>
</ul>
